"""BackupCopyPage — 'Backup copy' job wizard (extends WizardPage).

CALIBRATED live 2026-07-08 against nbr-84. Flow (FOUR steps, not FLB's six):
  1. Backups (tick an existing backup leaf in the job-type-grouped tree — reuses the FLB
     source tree's DOM/locators, see BackupCopyLocators docstring)
  -> 2. Destination (pick a target repo — reuses DestinationLocators as-is)
  -> 3. Schedule (Backup-Copy-only retention-mode radios + the SAME retention/immutability
     fields FLB has, reusing ScheduleLocators as-is)
  -> 4. Options (job name — reuses OptionsLocators as-is).

See BackupCopyLocators' docstring in locators.py for the full calibration notes: the
existing-backups tree, the Disk/Tape destination-type combo (Tape is no longer greyed out as of
2026-07-08 — a tape library was added), the repo-capability-gated 'Immutable for' checkbox
(disabled on non-Object-Lock repos, enabled on `*_Immutable` ones), and the 'Close the wizard?'
confirm dialog that Cancel pops once anything was touched (handled generically in
WizardPage.click_cancel()).

        titled 'File level backup job for physical machine', one per underlying job), so
        clicking by label text (expand_backup_group) only ever reaches the first one.

        The '+' glyph classes (x-tree-elbow-plus / x-tree-elbow-end-plus) are POSITIONAL
        (sibling order), not state — they never disappear or change when a row expands, and
        expanding a row triggers a full grid view refresh that detaches every row's DOM node
        (stale element handles from before the refresh silently no-op on click). An earlier
        version of this loop matched on those glyph classes and got stuck re-toggling the
        FIRST group open/closed forever, never reaching the second. The row's OWN class
        carries the real state instead: an expanded row gets 'x-grid-tree-node-expanded'
        added to it (verified live). Re-querying COLLAPSED_GROUP_ROW fresh each iteration
